##### How much time did you end up spending on it?

4 hours

##### What are some of the design decisions you made?

Not sure how to answer this question. I made it partially responsive and kept colours in one pallette

##### What do you like about your implementation?

Chance to work with charts, haven't done it for a while.

##### What would you improve next time?

- pass args to get custom history (x days)
- Filter out selected currency from the other select
- Create separate customizable component for button
- Format dates
- Sanitize all keys in response objects
- Add loading state
- implement proper typing

#### NOTE:

As I mentioned, I have a very little experience with typescript, that's why it is far from I would expect it should be.
